What is BlockChain?
BlockChain is like a group of puzzle that are unique and gives a beautiful images. Every piece is importante, because is unique 
and can join other more piezes. So the paramount idea is to asociate the puzzle as the block(of the BlockChain). Another important 
caracteristic is that a block only have 2 form to join it with the previous and following block. 

Do you think that BlockChain is a technology that can revolutionize the world? 
I think that will be an incorruptible technology because the data is organized by a blocks that is immutable, secure and 
avoid fraudulent activities because everyone is watching, everything has evidence.
I have three example why this will be a nice idea: First, is decentralized we can transfer money without a bank. 
We do not have to worry about paying the rates. On second hand, if we are a company we can do smart contract avoiding too many paperwork.
And when the work is done, the contract is also finish. 
We always hear when is voting that a percent of people says is fraud. 
With BlockChain no one can make any changes to the data. The elections will be veracious. Also, we can save medical and records.
