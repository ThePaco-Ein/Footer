BLOG 2: Do you think that BlockChain is a technology that can revolutionize the world? 
I think that will be an incorruptible technology because the data is organized by a blocks that is immutable, secure and 
avoid fraudulent activities because everyone is watching, everything has evidence.
I have three example why this will be a nice idea: First, is decentralized we can transfer money without a bank. 
We do not have to worry about paying the rates. On second hand, if we are a company we can do smart contract avoiding too many paperwork.
And when the work is done, the contract is also finish. 
We always hear when is voting that a percent of people says is fraud. 
With BlockChain no one can make any changes to the data. The elections will be veracious. Also, we can save medical and records.
